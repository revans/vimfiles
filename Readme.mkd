# VimFiles

Just a collection of things for Vim.

## Setup

An example of how you can set this up:

````
git clone https://github.com/revans/vimfiles.git $HOME/dotfiles

ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
ln -s $HOME/dotfiles/vim $HOME/.vim
````

Now you have a quick & dirty vim setup that is somewhat pleasing to use.
